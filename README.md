# Parking-Pad
**Crowdsource parking app** that allows users to rent spare parking spaces to other users in order to facilitate stress-free parking in bottleneck areas where parking is a nightmare.
Users can also view nearby parking (non-rental).

- Retrieve a personal **Google Map API Key** and **ParkWhiz API Key** [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and [here](http://www.parkwhiz.com/developers/).
- Start MongoDB locally by opening a CLI and entering ```mongod```. Leave this CLI window open in the background.
- Starting at the root of the repo, go to **client/src/utils/API.js** and on lines 4 and 5, replace **GoogleMapKEY** and **ParkWhizKEY** with your own api keys.
- Open a new CLI. Navigate to the cloned directory. Install the npm dependencies and start the server.
   
    ```yarn install```
